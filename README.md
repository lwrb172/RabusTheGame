You’re just another wage slave in a bleak, pixelated city where:

## 🌆 The Grind Never Ends

    Work soul-crushing jobs (glovo, collecting strawberries, parliamentary representative) to stay alive.

    Your "stats" are Hunger, Sleep, and Hygiene.

    Every paycheck disappears instantly - life is rough!

## 🏠 "Decorating" Your Apartment

    Choose between wide variety of furnitures to decorate house to your hearts content!

## 🐕 Your "Pet" is your best friend

    It will never leave you.

## 👊 Your worst enemy? Rabus.

    A dirty bastard that never gives up.

    His special move? Robbery.

    Your weapon? An old coin, only it can save your life.

🎮 Game Over Conditions:

    One of your stats goes to zero

    Rabus gets you
